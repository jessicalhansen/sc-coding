// Create a Shape base class with GetArea and GetName and IncreaseSize methods
// Create a Square class that extends the Shape class with a default side length of 1
// Create a Circle class that extends the Shape class with a default radius of 1
// The GetArea method should return the area of the shape
// The GetName method should return the name of the shape (“Square” or “Circle”)
// The IncreaseSize method should take a percentage parameter and increase the size of the shape by that percentage
// Create a collection of Shapes 
// Insert a Square object into the Shapes collection with a side length of 3
// Insert a Circle into the Shapes collection with a radius of 2
// Use a for loop to do the following for each shape:
// Print the name and area of the shape
// Increase the size of the shape by 10%
// Print the name and new area of the shape
